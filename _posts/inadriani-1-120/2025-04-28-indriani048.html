<h2>Email Isn’t Dead—It Just Needs a Better Subject Line</h2>
<p>You’ve heard the rumors—“Email marketing is dead.” Yeah, right. If email’s a ghost, it’s the kind that still gets a 420% ROI and fills your event faster than a TikTok challenge.</p>
<p>The real issue? Most emails are boring. And boring doesn’t sell tickets. If your subject line reads like a tax notice, expect it to land straight in the bin.</p>

<h2>Why Email Still Rules Event Promotion</h2>
<p>Email is personal, direct, and (mostly) free. Unlike social media, where posts get buried in seconds, emails land right in someone’s inbox. That’s prime real estate.</p>
<p>Plus, email gives you control. No weird algorithms. No shadowbans. Just a clean shot at saying, “Hey, we’ve got an event—and you don’t want to miss this.”</p>

<h3>Build the Hype—One Email at a Time</h3>
<p>Promoting an event with email is not about blasting your list 5 times the night before. It’s a slow burn—like a well-crafted coffee. Each email builds trust, excitement, and urgency.</p>
<p>I’ve run launches where 60% of ticket sales came from email. Not ads, not influencers—just solid, targeted email sequences.</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a High-Conversion Event Email Campaign</h2>
<p>One email rarely does the trick. You need a sequence. Here’s a proven structure I use for almost every campaign:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Announcement Email</b> – Share the “what” and “why.” Keep it short and punchy.</li>
  <li><b>Behind-the-Scenes</b> – Build connection with sneak peeks or speaker bios.</li>
  <li><b>Countdown to Event</b> – Add urgency with limited-time offers or early bird deals.</li>
  <li><b>Testimonial or Social Proof</b> – Show real people loving past events.</li>
  <li><b>Final Reminder</b> – Clear CTA, maybe a little FOMO.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each email should have a purpose—and one call to action. Don’t send a “kitchen sink” email with eight buttons and a full agenda. Decision fatigue is real.</p>

<h2>Subject Lines That Get Opened (And Actually Read)</h2>
<p>The subject line is 80% of your battle. If it sucks, no one will read the rest—even if your content is gold.</p>

<h3>What Works?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Curiosity: “This marketing trick filled 200 seats in 3 days”</li>
  <li>Urgency: “Last chance to claim your spot”</li>
  <li>Benefit: “Meet top creators at this free event”</li>
</ul>

<p>Personalization helps too. If you can say “Hey Sarah, ready to level up your skills?”—you’re already ahead.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience: From 8% Open Rate to 34%</h2>
<p>I once promoted a niche webinar with a cold list—open rates were a dismal 8%. I reworked the subject line, added emoji (just one, not twelve), and split the list into warm and cold leads. The result? A steady climb to 34% open rate in 3 emails.</p>
<p>The kicker? 70% of paid attendees came from email. Proof that copywriting matters way more than list size.</p>

<h2>Timing: When Should You Hit Send?</h2>
<p>There’s no magic hour for everyone, but here’s what’s worked for me over the years:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Tuesday-Thursday mornings</b> – Best for B2B or professional events</li>
  <li><b>Sunday evenings</b> – Great for casual, creative events (people plan their week)</li>
  <li><b>Final 48 hours</b> – This is when urgency converts big</li>
</ul>

<p>A/B test your timing when you can. What works for my crowd might flop for yours. The key is to experiment, not guess.</p>

<h2>Design Tips: Make Your Emails Look Less Like Emails</h2>
<p>Most email clients strip design anyway, so stick to simple layouts. Use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Short paragraphs</li>
  <li>Bold headers</li>
  <li>Clear buttons—not just links</li>
  <li>Mobile-friendly design</li>
</ul>

<p>A huge chunk of opens happen on phones. If your CTA button is tiny or buried below ten paragraphs, don’t expect clicks.</p>

<h2>Email List Building: Start Early, Grow Steady</h2>
<p>No list? No problem (yet). Start building one today. Use freebies, event teasers, or lead magnets related to your niche.</p>
<p>For example, when I hosted a copywriting bootcamp, I gave away a “Power Subject Line Cheatsheet.” It pulled in 210 new leads in two weeks—some of whom turned into paying attendees later.</p>

<h3>Tools I Recommend</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>MailerLite</b> – Simple, generous free plan</li>
  <li><b>ConvertKit</b> – Ideal for creators and segmenting</li>
  <li><b>Sendinblue</b> – Solid for transactional + promo emails</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever tool you choose, focus on clarity and automation. A drip campaign can do wonders while you sleep.</p>

<h2>Bonus Strategy: Use Email + Retargeting</h2>
<p>Want to level up? Pair email with Facebook or Instagram retargeting ads. Sync your email list to Meta Ads Manager and show personalized reminders to people who opened but didn’t click.</p>
<p>I once did this for a live workshop—email openers saw a video ad featuring behind-the-scenes prep. Result? 22% of them clicked the ad and signed up within 24 hours. Synergy, baby.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts: Email Done Right = People Show Up</h2>
<p>If you treat your email list like a real audience (not just numbers on a spreadsheet), they’ll reward you with real attention—and real attendance.</p>
<p>Write like you’re speaking to a friend. Make it easy to RSVP. And never underestimate the power of a well-timed reminder with a killer subject line.</p>

<p>So go ahead—warm up that list, hit send, and fill your event with people who can’t wait to be there. You got this.</p>
