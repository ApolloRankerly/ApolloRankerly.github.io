<h2>Is Blogger Still Worth It For AdSense In 2025 Let's Get Real</h2>
<p>Ah, Blogger. The platform many of us started with when dinosaurs still roamed the internet (okay, maybe not that long ago). But here we are in 2025, and people still ask — is Blogger still a good place to earn money with AdSense? Time to spill the tea based on my personal experiences and plenty of trial-and-error adventures.</p>

<h2>The State Of Blogger In 2025</h2>

<h3>Blogger Hasn't Gone Anywhere</h3>
<p>Despite rumors every year that Google might pull the plug on Blogger, it’s still alive and well. It’s not getting flashy updates like WordPress, but it remains stable, free, and incredibly beginner-friendly.</p>

<h3>Perfect For Certain Types Of Projects</h3>
<p>Blogger in 2025 works best for people who want:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Low-cost, low-maintenance blogs</p></li>
<li><p>Simple AdSense integration without technical headaches</p></li>
<li><p>Quick setup for small or niche projects</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's not trying to be everything for everyone, and honestly, that's part of its charm.</p>

<h2>My Recent Experience Running A Blogger Blog</h2>
<p>In late 2024, I decided to launch a micro-niche blog about "urban gardening hacks" — just for fun (and to test Blogger again). Here's what I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setup was ridiculously easy. Ten minutes and I had a working blog.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom domain setup (connecting to a .com I owned) took another 20 minutes tops.</p></li>
<li><p>Monetization with AdSense approval was smoother than expected because Blogger has built-in support.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By Month 5, the blog was making about $80/month from about 25,000 monthly views. Not bad for a side project with almost no overhead!</p>

<h2>Pros Of Using Blogger For AdSense In 2025</h2>

<h3>Zero Hosting Costs</h3>
<p>Unlike WordPress where hosting fees can add up, Blogger hosts your blog for free on Google's infrastructure. That’s a major win for beginners or side hustlers.</p>

<h3>Easy AdSense Integration</h3>
<p>Blogger and AdSense still play very nicely together. You can apply, get approved, and start showing ads directly from your Blogger dashboard without needing to install plugins or edit code.</p>

<h3>Decent SEO Potential</h3>
<p>While Blogger isn't packed with SEO bells and whistles, basic SEO (titles, meta descriptions, alt text) is easy to manage. I've had multiple Blogger posts rank on Page 1 for long-tail keywords.</p>

<h2>Cons Of Using Blogger For AdSense In 2025</h2>

<h3>Limited Design Flexibility</h3>
<p>If you want a beautiful, custom, jaw-dropping site... well, you might find Blogger templates a little bland unless you dive into HTML/CSS editing manually.</p>

<h3>Risk Of Platform Shutdown</h3>
<p>Yes, Blogger’s owned by Google, and yes, Google has a habit of axing products unexpectedly. While Blogger seems safe for now, it’s wise not to put all your eggs in one basket.</p>

<h3>Fewer Plugins And Tools</h3>
<p>Compared to WordPress’s endless plugin ecosystem, Blogger feels barebones. If you need advanced features like e-commerce, membership sites, or fancy pop-ups, Blogger will feel limiting fast.</p>

<h2>Case Study Blogger Blog Vs WordPress Blog For AdSense</h2>
<p>In 2023-2024, I managed two blogs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blogger Blog</strong> about DIY Crafts — easy setup, earned around $150/month at its peak from 30,000 monthly visitors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WordPress Blog</strong> about Health Tips — more complex setup, higher costs (hosting, plugins), but scaled to $700/month with similar traffic after optimizing ad layouts and using better RPM networks beyond just AdSense.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Blogger blog was simpler but hit a ceiling. WordPress offered more growth potential long-term — but also required way more work (and money) upfront.</p>

<h2>Who Should Still Use Blogger For AdSense In 2025</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>New bloggers testing the waters</p></li>
<li><p>Side hustlers wanting passive income streams with minimal expenses</p></li>
<li><p>People focusing on content, not fancy designs or features</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone needing a fast, low-risk MVP (Minimum Viable Project) for a blog idea</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips To Succeed With Blogger And AdSense</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Pick a tight niche with good AdSense CPC potential (finance, tech, health, DIY)</p></li>
<li><p>Publish at least 50-100 posts targeting long-tail keywords</p></li>
<li><p>Manually optimize your ad placements (don't just stick to defaults)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on site speed by compressing images and keeping themes lightweight</p></li>
<li><p>Always backup your Blogger content regularly, just in case</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts Blogger Is Still A Hidden Gem For AdSense In 2025</h2>
<p>Blogger might not be sexy. It’s not cutting-edge. But it gets the job done, especially for new bloggers who want a simple, reliable way to earn passive AdSense income without a huge investment.</p>

<p>Will it replace WordPress for serious blogging businesses? Probably not. But as a no-frills AdSense money-maker, Blogger is absolutely still worth considering in 2025 — just like that comfy pair of sneakers you can't quite give up.</p>

<p>So if you’ve been hesitating to start because you think Blogger is "outdated," trust me: it’s not dead, it’s just chill. And sometimes, chill is exactly what you need when building your online empire!</p>
