<h2>Why Emails Still Matter in a World of TikToks and Tweets</h2>
<p>Social media might grab the spotlight, but email is still where the magic happens. Why? Because it lands straight into someone’s inbox. No algorithm, no distractions—just you and your reader.</p>
<p>And when you’re promoting an event, that direct line is gold. I learned this firsthand while organizing a local creative workshop. We had almost zero budget and no influencer clout—but we had email. And it worked.</p>

<h2>The Secret? It’s Not Just What You Send, It’s When and How</h2>
<p>Most people treat email like a megaphone: “Hey! We have an event! Come join!” Then silence.</p>
<p>But good email strategy is more like a series of gentle nudges. You build anticipation, layer in value, and guide readers step-by-step from curiosity to conversion.</p>

<h2>How I Structured My Email Campaign (And You Can Too)</h2>
<p>I broke the campaign into three stages—each one designed to bring the reader closer to saying “yes.” Here's the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Stage 1 – Tease & Engage</b>: Send curiosity-building content without any pitch. Just a taste.</li>
  <li><b>Stage 2 – Inform & Build Trust</b>: Share event details, speaker bios, and behind-the-scenes prep.</li>
  <li><b>Stage 3 – Drive Urgency</b>: Hit them with limited seats, early-bird countdowns, and testimonials.</li>
</ul>

<p>This drip-style approach turned casual subscribers into active participants. Some even emailed *me* to say they couldn’t wait!</p>

<h2>Email #1: The Teaser That Sparked 37 Replies</h2>
<p>The first email didn’t mention the event directly. Instead, I shared a quick personal story about why I believe creativity is essential in today’s burnout culture.</p>
<p>At the end, I asked: “If there were a way to recharge creatively with others in your city, would you be interested?”</p>
<p>Replies poured in. That’s when I knew the interest was real—and warm leads were forming.</p>

<h2>Email #2: Introducing the Event Without Sounding Salesy</h2>
<p>In the second email, I formally introduced the event. I used a friendly tone and wrote as if I was talking to a friend over coffee, not blasting an ad.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Subject line</b>: “Something creative is brewing in town…”</li>
  <li><b>Body</b>: Gave the name, format, date, and who it’s for. Then linked to the landing page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The open rate? Over 54%. People were ready to learn more because they’d already been primed emotionally.</p>

<h2>Email #3: Let the Speakers Tell the Story</h2>
<p>Next, I sent an email featuring one of the guest speakers. Just a short Q&A, a quote, and a photo. That added legitimacy and built connection.</p>
<p>One subscriber said, “If she’s speaking, I’m definitely coming.” Boom—free word-of-mouth.</p>

<h2>Email #4: The One With the Deadline (And the Spike)</h2>
<p>This email came one week before the early-bird deadline. I made sure to add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>A countdown timer</b> (GIF-style works great)</li>
  <li><b>A success story from a previous attendee</b></li>
  <li><b>One clear CTA button</b>: “Save My Spot Now”</li>
</ul>

<p>Within 48 hours, registrations jumped by 45%. People hate missing out—it’s practically science.</p>

<h2>My Email Automation Stack (Simple but Mighty)</h2>
<p>You don’t need a complex CRM to run this. Here’s what I used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Mailerlite</b>: Easy to set up sequences and segment lists.</li>
  <li><b>Zapier</b>: To tag people who clicked but didn’t register.</li>
  <li><b>Google Sheets</b>: Yep, I tracked signups manually at one point!</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep it simple at first. What matters more is consistency and tone—not fancy tech.</p>

<h2>Common Email Mistakes I Learned to Avoid</h2>
<p>Let’s spare you the pain. Here’s what NOT to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Don’t send long blocks of text</b> – Break things up visually.</li>
  <li><b>Don’t over-design</b> – Fancy templates often feel cold. Plain text feels human.</li>
  <li><b>Don’t ask for too much too soon</b> – Build interest before asking for the RSVP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goal isn’t to force urgency—it’s to make people *want* to be part of something awesome.</p>

<h2>What Happens After They Register?</h2>
<p>Most event marketers drop the ball post-registration. But this is when you solidify their excitement.</p>

<p>I sent 2 follow-up emails:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Welcome email</b>: Included a calendar link, short thank-you video, and directions to the venue.</li>
  <li><b>1-day-before reminder</b>: Shared a checklist and “what to expect” notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over 90% of those who registered actually showed up—because they felt like part of something before it even began.</p>

<h2>The Real-World Result (With Just 273 Emails Sent)</h2>
<p>This simple email campaign helped fill up a 70-seat room in under two weeks. No ads. No influencers. Just storytelling, empathy, and timely nudges.</p>

<p>And guess what? About 40% of attendees brought a friend—doubling our impact.</p>

<h2>Your Turn: Craft Your Event’s Email Journey</h2>
<p>Start with why. Speak from the heart. Make it personal. Then guide people gradually into your event’s orbit.</p>

<p>Email isn’t dead—it’s just waiting for you to breathe life into it again.</p>
