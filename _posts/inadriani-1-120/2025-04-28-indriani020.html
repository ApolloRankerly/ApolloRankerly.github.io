<h2>The Big Question Which Platform Pays Better</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to monetize your blog with AdSense, the platform you choose matters a lot more than you think. I’ve run blogs on both WordPress and Blogger, and today, I’ll share my honest experience about which one brought in higher RPM and better earnings.</p>

<h2>Starting Out On Blogger My First AdSense Approval</h2>
<p>Blogger was my first love. It was simple, free, and easy to set up. Within three months, I got approved for AdSense with around 25 posts. Everything felt so smooth — until I checked my earnings after a few months of hard work.</p>

<h3>Blogger RPM Reality Check</h3>
<p>On Blogger, my RPM consistently hovered around $2 to $4. Even when I had good traffic days, it barely touched $5. I optimized placements, experimented with ad types, but the numbers stayed stubbornly low.</p>
<p>I realized something crucial: free platforms come with hidden limitations, especially when it comes to monetization potential.</p>

<h2>Moving To WordPress A Game Changer For Earnings</h2>
<p>After feeling stuck, I decided to invest in a self-hosted WordPress blog. The move wasn’t easy — setting up hosting, installing themes, managing plugins — it felt overwhelming at first.</p>
<p>But within two months, the difference in earnings became crystal clear.</p>

<h3>WordPress RPM Advantage</h3>
<p>On WordPress, my RPM jumped dramatically. Average days saw $8 to $10 RPM, and some good days crossed $12. Same content quality, similar traffic levels — but much better revenue.</p>
<p>It felt like switching from riding a bicycle to driving a turbocharged car. I finally saw my efforts translating into real, scalable income.</p>

<h2>Why WordPress Earns Higher RPM Than Blogger</h2>

<h3>Better Ad Placement Control</h3>
<p>WordPress lets you control exactly where and how your ads appear. I could insert ads in better spots — after paragraphs, between images, in sidebars, footers, everywhere. On Blogger, ad placements were more restricted and often awkward-looking.</p>

<h3>Better Site Speed And SEO</h3>
<p>With WordPress, I could optimize my blog for faster loading and better SEO practices. A faster, more SEO-friendly site attracts better ads and more premium advertisers, which directly boosts RPM.</p>

<h3>Professional Appearance And Trust Factor</h3>
<p>WordPress blogs just look and feel more professional. This increases user engagement, time on page, and bounce rate — all factors Google considers when deciding which ads (and how much value) to assign to your site.</p>

<h2>Case Study Earnings Snapshot WordPress Vs Blogger</h2>

<h3>Blogger</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Monthly Pageviews: 20,000</p></li>
<li><p>Average RPM: $3.5</p></li>
<li><p>Monthly Earnings: Around $70</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>WordPress</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Monthly Pageviews: 18,000</p></li>
<li><p>Average RPM: $9.2</p></li>
<li><p>Monthly Earnings: Around $165</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice something interesting? Even with fewer pageviews, WordPress almost doubled my AdSense earnings compared to Blogger.</p>

<h2>Other Hidden Benefits Of WordPress</h2>

<h3>Access To Better Plugins</h3>
<p>With plugins like Ad Inserter and WP Rocket, I could automate ad placements, improve site speed, and manage ads without touching any code. Blogger didn’t have that level of flexibility.</p>

<h3>Better Analytics And Testing</h3>
<p>I could run A/B tests on different layouts, try different ad sizes, and track what worked best — something Blogger made incredibly difficult.</p>

<h2>Should You Switch From Blogger To WordPress</h2>
<p>If you’re serious about building a long-term income through AdSense, my advice is simple: move to WordPress as soon as you can. Yes, there’s a learning curve. Yes, it’s not free like Blogger. But the long-term rewards absolutely crush any short-term headaches.</p>
<p>WordPress gives you full control of your blog, your content, and most importantly, your earnings potential.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict WordPress Wins For AdSense RPM</h2>
<p>After years of trying both, there’s no doubt in my mind: WordPress beats Blogger for earning higher AdSense RPM and building a real, profitable blog. Blogger is fine for learning. But if you want to actually make serious money, WordPress is the path to take.</p>
<p>Trust me — once you see those higher earnings rolling in, you’ll wonder why you didn’t switch sooner.</p>
