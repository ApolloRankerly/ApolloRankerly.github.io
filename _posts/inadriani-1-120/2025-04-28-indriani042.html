<h2>One Email Isn’t Enough (Seriously)</h2>
<p>You know that excited feeling when someone signs up for your event updates? It’s a warm lead! And then what do most people do?</p>
<p>They send one email. Maybe two. And that’s it.</p>
<p>Bad move. Because silence = forgetfulness. Your audience is busy, distracted, and bombarded with messages every single day. That’s why email drip campaigns exist—to keep the conversation going without being annoying.</p>

<h2>What’s a Drip Campaign (and Why You Need One)?</h2>
<p>A drip campaign is a series of pre-written, automated emails that go out on a schedule. For event promotion, it’s your secret weapon to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build anticipation</li>
  <li>Answer questions proactively</li>
  <li>Highlight speakers, perks, or bonuses</li>
  <li>Drive early registration or ticket sales</li>
  <li>Reduce drop-offs by staying top-of-mind</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, it’s like dating your audience. You don’t propose on the first message—you nurture the relationship until they’re ready to commit.</p>

<h2>Real Talk: What Happens Without a Drip Strategy</h2>
<p>I’ve seen it too many times. An event gets a little buzz from ads or organic traffic, grabs a few email addresses, and then… crickets. No follow-up, no excitement, no reminders. The result? Weak turnout and zero engagement.</p>
<p>Now compare that with a campaign I ran last year. We set up a 7-email drip, spaced out over 3 weeks. Each email had one clear value nugget. We tripled our attendance compared to the previous year—with the exact same event budget.</p>

<h2>How to Structure a Winning Drip Campaign</h2>
<p>Let’s break it down step-by-step:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Email 1 – Welcome & Tease</b><br>Thank them for joining and share the big idea behind your event.</li>
  <li><b>Email 2 – Value Hook</b><br>What will they learn, gain, or experience? Use bullets. Make it juicy.</li>
  <li><b>Email 3 – Speaker/Performer Highlight</b><br>Share bios, clips, or past talk highlights.</li>
  <li><b>Email 4 – Testimonials or Case Studies</b><br>Social proof! Show past attendees raving.</li>
  <li><b>Email 5 – Limited Time Offer</b><br>Early bird ticket, freebie, or bonus session. Add urgency.</li>
  <li><b>Email 6 – FAQs & Objection Busting</b><br>Address common doubts. Be transparent.</li>
  <li><b>Email 7 – Final Reminder</b><br>Event’s around the corner. Time to lock it in!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can adjust the number or spacing depending on your event timeline. Just make sure every email adds new value.</p>

<h2>Which Platform Should You Use?</h2>
<p>I’ve tested a bunch, and here are my go-to tools for running smooth drip campaigns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>MailerLite</b> – Easy automation and perfect for small budgets.</li>
  <li><b>ConvertKit</b> – Great for creators and simple visual flows.</li>
  <li><b>ActiveCampaign</b> – Advanced logic and segmentation (worth it for big events).</li>
  <li><b>Sendinblue</b> – Includes SMS drip, which can be spicy if used right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing Emails That People Actually Open</h2>
<p>Even the best strategy fails if your emails get ignored. Here's what works for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Use casual subject lines</b> – “Guess who’s speaking?” beats “Upcoming Event Info.”</li>
  <li><b>Write like a human</b> – Less corporate, more coffee chat.</li>
  <li><b>Make it scannable</b> – Bullets, bolding, short paragraphs. No walls of text.</li>
  <li><b>Always link to your landing page</b> – Ideally with one strong CTA button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pro tip: personalize the sender name too. Emails from “Jamie at GrowthFest” feel more trustworthy than “info@company.com.”</p>

<h2>Case Study: Small List, Big Results</h2>
<p>For a virtual masterclass I helped promote, we had a modest email list of 850 subscribers. Using a 5-part drip campaign with a light, witty tone and personal stories, we converted 200+ attendees.</p>
<p>No spammy tactics. Just relevance, timing, and genuine value. Oh, and one email had a meme. People loved it.</p>

<h2>Segment or Bust</h2>
<p>Drip campaigns work even better when you segment your list. Here are easy ways to split it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signed up from ads vs. organic</li>
  <li>Local vs. international attendees</li>
  <li>New vs. returning</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows you to tailor your messaging—and that’s a fast track to higher open rates and conversions.</p>

<h2>Bonus Tip: Post-Event Follow-Up</h2>
<p>Don’t ghost people after the event. Use one or two final drips to say thanks, share highlights, or promote replays. It builds goodwill and primes them for your next event.</p>

<h2>Final Thought: One Click, Many Touches</h2>
<p>People rarely act on the first message. Your email drip is your digital drumbeat, reminding them why your event matters and nudging them toward the finish line.</p>
<p>So go ahead—set it, automate it, and watch the signups roll in. Your future self (and your attendance numbers) will thank you.</p>
